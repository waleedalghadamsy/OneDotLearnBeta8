# One Dot Learn 

Version 0.0.18

This is a web portal. It is intended for anyone from anywhere who wishes to attend online courses.

**<u>Final Target:</u>**

Ultimatey (maybe within one year after launch), this platform might become somehow similar to Udemy.

**<u>Courses</u>**

In the beginning, courses will be mainly IT related, but later on, it will be open to any kind of courses.

**<u>Audience</u>**

Targeted audience will be either trainees or instructors. Trainees will be able to attend courses, while instructors will be able to create and teach courses.

At least for the first year, the platform will be open to anyone who wishes to attend courses. Courses will be mainly directed (or dedicated) to the following countries (in the shown sequence):
1. Libya
2. Egypt
3. Jordan
4. Tunisia
5. The Gulf States (KSA, UAE, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait)
5. Syria
6. Iraq

Welcoming audience from these counries will be gradual. The beginning will be with Libya for maybe the first 3 months. Then Egypt and so on.

The most essential criterion for opening any country (after Libya) is ***the availability and ease of implementing <u>"payment gateways"</u> in that country***.

**<u>Currencies</u>**

The fees of each course will be shown in the local currency of the country where the course is directed to. For example, courses directed to Libya will be in LYD (Libyan Dinar), while courses directed to Egypt will be declared in EGP (Egyptian Pound), and so. In addition, fees will also be shown in US Dollars.
Internally, the fees of all courses will be set in US Dollars. 

Therefore, two mechansims will be implemented for this matter. One mechanism to automatically detect the user's coutry and the other to convert the internal fees value from Dollars to the local currency.
